 Script Name: aggregate_annual_indicators.py
 Author: Igor Latii
 Description:
     This script performs annual aggregation and interpolation on the merged
     dataset (`merged_df_readable.csv`) created in the previous phase.

     The purpose is to harmonize indicators with different temporal frequencies
     (monthly, quarterly, annual) into a single annual dataset suitable for
     exploratory data analysis (EDA).

     Specifically, the script:
        1. Loads the merged multi-indicator dataset.
        2. Groups observations by year.
        3. Sums continuous (economic and transport) indicators to represent
           total annual activity.
        4. Averages discrete (event-based or demographic) indicators to obtain
           representative annual levels.
        5. Applies linear interpolation to continuous indicators with small gaps.
        6. Saves the resulting annual dataset for use in subsequent analysis.

 Output:
     /data/processed/merged/merged_df_annual.csv

 Dependencies:
     - pandas
     - os
